        <p>
        This project began with me selecting approximately 10 locations in my surroundings and collecting bacteria present in those places.<br/>
        <br> I became interested in the growth and changes of living organisms, finding the characteristics of invisible bacteria intriguing.<br/>
        <br> Microbes, as single-celled organisms with very small and simple shapes, exist not only in the human body but also in various natural environments.<br/>
        When conditions are suitable for their growth, they exhibit tremendous reproductive abilities, continuously producing mutations and giving birth to various organisms.I studied their attributes, cultured them, and observed their generated mutations, aiming to visualize them as aesthetic images.<br/>
        <br> I arranged various forms of tiny organisms together, allowing viewers to compare different shapes. I presented these microorganisms in a magnifying glass format, showcasing them with vibrant colors to emphasize their characteristics and stimulate visual interest.<br/>
        <br> Regardless of where they were collected or the environment they grew in, most microorganisms ultimately have similar shapes. 
         This illustrates that regardless of the form, they are all the same living organisms, highlighting their coexistence in various environments.
         It also serves to remind us that there is no need to place any life form above another, recognizing the equal value of all living beings.
