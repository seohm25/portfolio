            The individual response to and interpretation of sound can vary widely from person to person, and this diversity in how we engage with sound offers endless creative possibilities.<br/> 
            <br> In particular, sound contributes as a valuable factor in shaping our memories. Paying attention to mundane sounds, especially sounds made by nature, I tried to visualize the sounds created by movements of pebbles found in the garden of my apartment complex.<br/> 
            <br> I recorded the sound of pebbles rubbing against each other on bristol paper.<br/> 
            I was interested in the subtle sounds made by these small elements that can resemble the sound of larger natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning when the speed of the recorded sound slows down dramatically.<br/> 
            <br> Further, this could take us to wander into something beyond the sound of pebbles; an abstracted sound image, which could be a resource for looking into a relationship between our memory and sound. It was worth examining.<br/>
