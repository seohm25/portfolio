            What do you see in art?<br/>
            <br>How much of an artwork can we actually see (understand)?<br/>
            
            <br>This work began with the plain and flat perspective of American poet William Carlos Williams. 
            First of all, I focused on looking at the shape of the 3m long charger that I always carry. 
            And I expressed the complexly intertwined appearance of the charger using various drawing methods. 
            While drawing and concentrating on the shape of the charger, I naturally began to think about the relationship between my daily life and this charger, 
            and I felt that my life and this charger were similar in that they were complex yet steadfast in supplying energy (electricity).<br/>
            
            <br>When we look at an object, we first grasp the visual information of the object and then imagine beyond that. And from the visual characteristics of objects, new perspectives with meaning are imagined based on personal memories or experiences with the object.<br/>
            
            <br>Seeing memories or reflecting objects is meaningful because it allows us to understand the fundamental values of the elements in the world as a visual creator.
