        <p> <br><br/>'City people' series are about the momentary images of people in the city. When I see people coming and going in and out of the city, they have their own facial expressions.
            Sometimes when I look at them, I often find it interesting to see them staying in their personal thoughts.<br/>
            <br>I personally think their appearance is a connection that stimulates curiosity about their thoughts or concerns and makes them imagine various stories in a scene.
