        This mushroom series, rooted in my interest in nature, focuses on the movements of living organisms and records their changes. 
        Over the course of about a week, 
        I cultivated mushrooms and captured their growth and transformation through time- lapse photography.<br/>
        <br>Mushrooms, as fungi, belong to neither the animal nor the plant kingdom, and they adapt easily to various environments. 
        In other words, they are intelligent life forms capable of responding to and adapting to their surroundings.
        Observing their perseverance, wisdom, and adaptability in new environments,
        <br>I envision my future self- living in a different place.<br/>

        <br>The motion graphic work involves creating a moving poster based on the movement of mushrooms. 
        Nine shapes are geometrically and simply arranged in accordance with the mushroom's movements.
        In this circular yet fluid motion graphic, I expressed various characteristics of mushrooms, highlighting their resilient vitality.<br/>
        
        <br>Additionally, as I researched information about mushrooms, I understood their potential and boundless possibilities. 
        According to American mycologist Paul Stamets, mushrooms possess sustainable natural abilities, such as being able to heal diseases, act as pesticides, and contribute to forest management.<br/>
        <br>I believe that just like mushrooms, which connect all life forms, they can serve as a great intermediary for sustaining the Earth's beautiful environment.
